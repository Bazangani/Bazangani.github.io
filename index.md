As an enthusiastic learner after my PhD in data science and AI, I find huge fun in solving the complexities of data, designing intelligent algorithms, and studying the state of the art. 


Easy AI is a website dedicated to exploring and sharing my interest in the domains of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 

This is a place to find hands-on projects, insightful experiences, and cutting-edge state-of-the-art in Artificial Intelligence. Here, I simplify even the most complex models, making AI accessible to all. Explore projects, gain insights, and stay updated with the latest advancements, all presented in an easy-to-understand format. 


I hope to share my passion with other learners!
